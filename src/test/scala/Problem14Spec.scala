The first two reactions use only ORE as inputs; they indicate that you can produce as much of chemical A as you want (in increments of 10 units, each 10 costing 10 ORE) and as much of chemical B as you want (each costing 1 ORE). To produce 1 FUEL, a total of 31 ORE is required: 1 ORE to produce 1 B, then 30 more ORE to produce the 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 A (with 2 extra A wasted) required in the reactions to convert the B into C, C into D, D into E, and finally E into FUEL. (30 A is produced because its reaction requires that it is created in increments of 10.)

Or, suppose you have the following list of reactions:

9 ORE => 2 A
8 ORE => 3 B
7 ORE => 5 C
3 A, 4 B => 1 AB
5 B, 7 C => 1 BC
4 C, 1 A => 1 CA
2 AB, 3 BC, 4 CA => 1 FUEL
The above list of reactions requires 165 ORE to produce 1 FUEL:

Consume 45 ORE to produce 10 A.
Consume 64 ORE to produce 24 B.
Consume 56 ORE to produce 40 C.
Consume 6 A, 8 B to produce 2 AB.
Consume 15 B, 21 C to produce 3 BC.
Consume 16 C, 4 A to produce 4 CA.
Consume 2 AB, 3 BC, 4 CA to produce 1 FUEL.
